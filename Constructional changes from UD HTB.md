## Constructional changes from UD HTB
The following analyses differ from UD HTB for the reasons listed below, and are implemented in the new sample data.

### Clausal subjects
The current analysis of סביר as an auxiliary in HTB looks wrong and should probably be revised, since it is actually the predicate, not an auxiliary, and the ש clause is not really an advcl:
HTB analysis with סביר as AUX:

tree

Suggested analysis used in new data with סביר as ADJ:

tree

### Infinitives marked by ‘prepositions’
Constructions like the following should be mark, not case, since the function word introduces a clause (in this case, infinitival):
HTB:

tree

Suggestion:

### Adverbial ‘auxiliaries’
Current UD guidelines and the UD validator prohibit the deprel advmod for words not tagged ADV; HTB has אינו + VERB tagged as AUX + advmod. I recommend changing this to deprel aux with Polarity=Neg:

tree

### Additional function words
The following function words were encountered in sample data which were not found in HTB, for which we recommend these guidelines:
-	 לכש – leave as one token
-	ה|די משמעותי (definite הדי before + ADJ) - split הדי, analyzed as the article attached to the adjective, not to די, with די as an adverb to the ADJ.

### Free relatives
The original HTB had no consistent analysis for free relatives, in which an interrogative pronoun fulfills the role of both a matrix clause and a subordinate clause argument. The standard practice from other language UD TBs is to consistently prefer the matrix clause function and attachment, attaching the subordinate predicate as acl:relcl, and reserving the subordinate function and attachment for future annotation via enhanced dependencies as desired (as implemented e.g. in the UD English treebanks).

For example, simple dependencies for מה, which is obj of both the matrix clause and the subordinate clause in the following example, should be annotated as follows:

tree

Note that in this analysis, the internal dependency of מה as the object of אומר is neglected, though it could be represented in enhanced dependencies, if these were to be added to the Hebrew treebank data.

In rare cases, the free relative analysis cannot be expressed via the relation acl:relcl due to ellipsis. Consider the following example:

אין לנו דרך טובה יותר לתאר את שמתרחש בבית החינוך במכללת אורנים

In a “full” realization, this could be re-formulated with “מה שמתרחש”, resulting in the same analysis as above, with acl:relcl from מה to מתרחש. However, because מה is missing, we must apply a promotion analysis. Since UD prefers preserving the matrix argument structure over embedded structures in the simple dependencies, the priority is given to preserving the argument structure of לתאר, which should take a direct object. As a result, מתרחש must inherit the obj function and case dependent of the missing מה, resulting in the following analysis:

tree

### Determiners should not be tagged as ADV
UD validation prohibits the function det on words tagged anything but PRON and DET. Therefore we should tag עוד חברה and יותר חברות as DET.

### Adverbially used NPs
Because of the UD prohibition on the relation advmod for tokens not tagged as ADV (or part of a multiword fixed expression), adverbially used NPs are attached as obl/nmod as appropriate, depending on the POS of the parent, even though they do not carry prepositions:

### Tagging of names and internal modifiers

HTB is not consistent in tagging proper names which consist of otherwise common nouns, though it consistently avoids PROPN on non-noun parts of names. I recommend generalizing this practice for consistency, for example:

tree

HTB regularly tags acronyms such as צה”ל as PROPN, but in this example it seems reasonable that חיל ההנדסה הקרבית also functions as a name. In keeping with HTB practices, קרבית and the function words within the name are tagged as usual, while the noun parts are tagged PROPN.
An exception to this guidelines is the consistent treatment of common noun titles in HTB as NOUN, which we have kept in newly tagged data as well, for example:

tree


Note that this practice is not consistent with UD English data (Mr./PROPN, General/PROPN), but is consistent with UD Arabic data (الشيخ and similar). Words not used as common nouns, however, are consistently tagged as PROPN, for example רבי (as a final-stressed name component, like רבי עקיבא). This appears at least superficially inconsistent, and we may want to change this.

### Dates and nummod

Unlike the original HTB practice of denoting numerical temporal modifiers as nummod, we attach years to month names, or in full dates to the day, since nothing is really being counted, cf. UD English GUM). 

tree

### Auxiliaries and negation
Auxiliaries should be listed somewhere. They currently include:
●	 יכול
●	 אמור
●	 אפשר
●	 צפוי
●	 ניתן
●	...
One issue arising with auxiliaries is handling special negation, such as אי אפשר. This is currently handled with אי attached as compound:affix to אפשר, but this is invalid according to UD guidelines and validation scripts, which prohibit dependents of tokens labeled aux.
The two possibilities are either treating it as a fixed expression, or attaching the negation to the main verb. Although it is morphosyntactically counterintuitive, I recommend the second option, since it avoids a multiword fixed auxiliary (creates problems for the language-specific list of auxiliaries in the validator), and streamlines the handling of complex predicate negation (looks exactly like standard לא, e.g. לא ניתן לעשות). This is generally the handling of negated modal auxiliaries across UD.


-	Current analysis: (invalid)

tree

-	Solution 1: (valid according to guidelines, but incompatible with current UD validator)

tree

-	Solution 2: (my choice, equivalent to current UD English analysis of can’t + VERB)

tree

Here are some cases where אי אפשר is not followed by INF. 
First, we have a case of a subordinate clause. So following your recommendation, I’m assuming that we have the same analysis of אי אפשר modifying לעמוד, and then לא is modifying it, too: a double negation, rehteorically it is a litotes. 
אי אפשר שלא לעמוד בפיתויים החושיים שמציעים לנו מטבחים ואין על כך שום פלא.
By analogy to the English treatment, both ‘i and efshar, as functional elements, would modify laamod.

And this? 
אי אפשר , כמובן , בלי כמה משפטים על ליאונל מסי וארגנטינה .
This is different: the sense is i efshar plus an elided infinitive (i efshar laasot X bli …), so efshar would be promoted to the head, bli kama mishpatim is obl to that, and ‘i is a simple negation to efshar, the root. See promotion above, and here.

Same here? אי negates יהיה? 
אבל מה לעשות , דווקא אצלכם , אי אפשר יהיה ( לפחות בעתיד הנראה לעין ) להעביר את כל הענין לרשת .
No, yihiye is also AUX, so they all modify lehaavir (incl. ‘i and efshar separately)

Are the following elliptical? How would you analyze them? 
Can this be an advmod modifying יותר? 
לכולנו יש רגעים שבהם אי אפשר יותר .
Efshar would be promoted to the head of the acl:relcl, all words in the relative clause would depend on it.

This is an obvious case of ellipsis. How do we go about it? 
הגוף מפנה הרבה משאבים כדי לייצר חיים חדשים וזו לא תקופה טובה כ"כ להעמיס יותר , גם אם אח"כ אי אפשר.
The same, efshar is promoted to head of the advcl. In enhanced dependencies you could add an ellipsis token to represent the missing infinitive, and in edeps efshar would be aux to it.
אי אפשר has a different function here, and I suspect we are going to get more creatures like that when we work on the language variety of the social media, where phrases such as אין דברים כאלה and the like are ubiquitous. Perhaps it’s premature, but we may want to start thinking about solving these harder cases. 
בלי עורכים ומתרגמים אי אפשר , אז קבלו את יעל סלע שפירו .
Perhaps I’m biased to expecting an infinitive argument, but again I would promote efshar here. Otherwise you would get different structures when you have a VERB and also the bli phrase, which seems less consistent. In English, where modals are expected to take infinitives, the modal would be head of its clause and dominate the PP as obl, for example:

https://corpling.uis.georgetown.edu/annis/?id=afc52611-284d-4b80-b5ca-500fa3df16df



### Functions of גם
When attached to a single NP, גם is currently tagged ADV but attached as det. I propose attaching it as advmod, as done in other languages. For the structure גם ... וגם I recommend using two cc attachments, again in keeping with guidelines for many other languages (both X and Y, etc.).

## Other Recommendations (open)

The following recommendations have not yet been implemented in the new sample data, and may require more discussion and/or manual intervention and are left for future work:

### Removal of some relation subtypes 
UD_Hebrew-HTB uses a large number of dependency relation subtypes not found in other treebanks. I would recommend removing the following based on the argumentation below:
-	Case subtypes: labels such as case:gen and case:acc for של and את respectively seem redundant, since there are already morphological features for case, and they are deterministically predictable from the lemma and function. 
-	The nsubj:cop subtype: copular subjects are not generally distinguished in other UD treebanks, and the presence of a copula, or other non-verbal predication, can be read directly from the graph
-	The subtype flat:name is the only type of flat used in the corpus, therefore it would make sense to change it to simple flat. You don’t expect other “flats”? 
-	The subtype mark:q is used for האם and שמא, even when not used in an actual question. Since we have the word form/lemma and function mark as a deterministic predictor of this relation, I think it should be removed and simplified to mark. The item האם is also tagged ADV, but I think it should be SCONJ.
-	HTB has no passive labels – we added nsubj:pass and csubj:pass for passive subjects (useful for argument structure extraction, common in many TBs, incl. Arabic)

### Adding missing features
-	Polarity=Neg is used sporadically in HTB, but probably should be used consistently for all negative items, including לא, אי, בלתי, אין etc.
-	Typo=Yes is not currently used but likely to be needed for User Generated Content
-	Poss=Yes is not currently used for fused possessive pronouns, but should probably be added and this can be automated easily.
